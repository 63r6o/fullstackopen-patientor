# Patientor - Full Stack Open Part 9, final exercise

This repository contains the final exercise of [Part 9 of the Full Stack open course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part9/grande_finale_patientor) from the University of Helsinki. In this project, I extended an existing codebase for the front end and developed a back end from scratch.

### Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- React
- React Router
- Material-UI
- Express
- Node.js

### Project Overview

The project's primary focus is on demonstrating proficiency with the technologies and not on the visual design.
Types are properly validated throughout the codebase, the data is being saved in memory (no database).

### Getting Started

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the patientor and patientor-backend folders.
2. In each folder, run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
3. After installation, run `npm run dev` to start the development server for both the front end and back end.
